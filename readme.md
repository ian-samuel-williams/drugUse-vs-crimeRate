# Drug Use VS Crime Rate in the US

Many of the US population were shocked when Oregon decriminalized 
possession of all illicit drugs in the fall of 2020. Possessing 
small quantities of illegal drugs in Oregon leads to a small fine instead 
of probation, in the name of recovery and treatment towards those addicted 
to drugs. Complaints arose across the country against this seemingly 
illogical and irrational decision. One of the concerns about this 
decriminalization against all drugs was the claim that drugs cause people 
to be violent, and thus in this study I would like to compare data across 
the states revolving around drug use and violence to see what drugs 
influence crime most, where drug use is most prevalent, and explore 
whether decriminalizing drugs was a good idea in Oregon.
